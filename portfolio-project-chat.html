							<h3 class="headline-font-sm">Working in a Remote Team for a Startup</h3>
							<p>Natalie and Alex Gonzalez flew out from their home in New York to Las Vegas, hoping to relocate their startup here. I was really impressed by these two 20-somethings who had already established themselves as entrepreneurs by founding two startups previously. Their current product, Chatalog, is a shopping comparison app with chat capabilities. I was hired as front-end developer for a period of time because I completing a coding challenge for Natalie and Alex by creating a responsive front page from a Photoshop comp. Work slowed down after the initial app was created and I moved on, but all in all, it was a wonderful experience working with some really smart, motivated people.</p>

							<h2 class="headline-font-sm">I Really Like Working Remotely</h2>This was not my first time working remotely. I finished my BA and took my entire MISM online. I wrote the thesis for our group of three students; the others lived in California and we managed to crank out over 100 pages in about 6 weeks, and got an A in the class. I was assigned most of the writing duties as my BA was in English and I like to write. I've worked remotely on several freelance web design projects under Indico Web Development--Magnolia Women's Recovery Program (CA), Infant Swimming (AZ), Arizona Title and Escrow (AZ)... I've also helped Dr. Linda Stewart edit her PhD Dissertation and helped Jaime Arroyo with his thesis project for his MBA. I think that if more companies allowed remote workers, people could live in currenly underemployed areas such as the Midwest, and housing rates in Silicon Valley might go down. There are a lot of plusses to remote work.
							<p></p>
							<p>I had to be more of a Jack-of-all-trades on this project. I learned some Knockout JS, which we used as middleware. I worked with Visual Studio for the first time. I learned how to use Git and GitHub on a daily basis. I realized I'm pretty quick at learning new things, which I had to be in a time-sensitive position such as this one--deadlines HAD to be met or there would be no product to show initial investors.</p>

							<h2 class="headline-font-sm">My Process for Chatalog</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Talk on Skype and work in person with business owners to determine his priorities for the website and what it needs to be fully functional.</li>
								<li>Set up new accounts on GitHub and Basecamp; get acclimated with Visual Studio and working with the backend developer, who was a Microsoft guy, while I consider myself more of an open source gal.</li>
								<li>Keep communication lines open continuously as small and large changes were made to the design and the functionality of the product.</li>
								<li>Write clean, efficient code to provide a responsive design after receiving Photoshop mockups from other graphic designers.</li>
								<li>Work closely with the backend developer on Basecamp; upload daily work to GitHub.</li>

							<h3>Time Management<br>
							<small>Personal Development</small></h3>
							<p>Working for a startup, the day started at 7AM, as I was on Pacific Standard Time, the Gonzalez's were on Eastern Standard Time, and the backend developer was on Central Time. The work I did took anywhere from 8 to 14 hours a day. However, working on something this interesting and stimulating made the time fly by for me, even on very long days.</p>

							<h3>New Technology<br>
							<small>Visual Studio, Knockout JS, GitHub</small></h3>
							<p>I had a lot of new (to me) technology thrown at me and was expected to get up to speed in a very short period of time. I also worked directly under a backend developer who was completely used to Microsoft products and coding, when I was absolutely not. It worked out in the long run for me because the next year I took a contract job using Visual Studio to write T-SQL and I felt more comfortable this time around.</p>

							<h3>Getting Better at Learning New Stuff Fast<br>
							<small>Working at a Startup</small></h3>
							<p>I realized I enjoyed the rush of working for a startup, but there was a lot of pressure to perform and my skillset was a little short in some areas--especially Javascript. The time I didn't spend working I spent learning online. I also got much better with Responsive Design--designing for mobile phones, tablets, etc. because a lot of people would be accessing Chatalog with these devices and the site had to look great small, medium and large.</p>

							<h3>Marketing and Social Media<br>
							<small>eCommerce</small></h3>
							<p>Because the site and the app were consumer products strongly tied to social media, I spent a lot of time researching online marketing and the best use cases for social media. I developed an interest in both and continue to study these aspects of business through reading HubSpot, Contently, and other eCommerce development websites.</p>
