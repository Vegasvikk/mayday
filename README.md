my current portfolio stuff
So this repository holds everything I've been working on for over a month that I need to save as my online portfolio/CV. I am adding a few project pages but mostly trying to focus on my most recent work, which is helping with East Boston Tech Meetup, learning UX/UI from U of M Micromasters program, and writing content.
